    <h1>Test Page One</h1>
    <h2>What's the purpose of this page?</h2>
    <p>This is a simple web page to demonstrate how the debugger works. This page will show you what
        happens when tags are <em>improperly used, missed or written incorrectly.</p>
    <p>When you write HTML code properly, putting together web pages should be easy. A simple page should be super easy.
        If it's not, you may be missing some essential tags or misunderstanding how to use them properly. </p>
    <p?Remember this - a simple page put together using HTML should be easy. </p>
        <p>A simple page should be easy. <strong>A simple web page should be easy.</strong><strong><em>A simple web page
                    should be easy.</strong></em>

            <h3>Here's an example of a random table to test</h3>
            <table>
                <caption>Look What I learned Already</caption>
                <<tr>
                    <th>Table heading</th>
